Title: Hybrid Assembling System

Objective: The primary objective of this project is to develop a system for effective sorting of very large input data in short span.

Technologies: Java 8 SE, JUnit.

Tools & Platform: Netbeans IDE, Git (Version Control), JUnit (Unit Testing Framework).

Functionality : This system has been implemented with sorting algorithms such as insertion and quick sorts. It internally calls insertion sort algorithm for the smaller lists since it becomes more efficient then the Quicksort. Think of it as grinding away with the Quicksort then polishing it off with the Insertion sort once most of the work has been done.

The following goals have been achieved by the above application:

● The system runs in Java programming language that frequently switches between insertion and quick depending on the input data.
● The application works within the best case time complexity of quick sort (O(nlog(n))) for any size of input file ranging from 10 to 1,00,00,000.
● Saved 50% of time and resources by using Hybrid assembling concept that can be applied anywhere as the business logic. This system has been tested using Junit Framework in java.

Achievements: 
-- Achieving the best case time complexity for any input size and reduced the sorting time by 50% for very large input size.
